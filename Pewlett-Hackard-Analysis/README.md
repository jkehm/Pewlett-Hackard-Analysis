# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis
The manager at Pewlett-Hackard has been impressed with the work that Bobby and I have done in SQL thus far. To add to our analysis, we will need to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. From there we will create  a report in order to help prepare the manager for teh potential "silver tsunami."
### Results
* 
* It is clear that there is a large amount of Senior Staff and Senior Engineers that will be retiring soon, which can be seen in the retiring_titles.csv file. This is indicative that Pewlett-Hackard should make sure to train, and promote their internal engineer and staff, or start hiring.
