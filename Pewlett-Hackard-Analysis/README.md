# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Overview of the Analysis
The manager at Pewlett-Hackard has been impressed with the work that Bobby and I have done in SQL thus far. To add to our analysis, we will need to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. From there we will create  a report in order to help prepare the manager for teh potential "silver tsunami."
### Results
* A large percent of the company is considered to be within retirement age.
* It is clear that there is a large amount of Senior Staff and Senior Engineers that will be retiring soon, which can be seen in the retiring_titles.csv file. This is indicative that Pewlett-Hackard should make sure to train, and promote their internal engineer and staff, or start hiring.

* The amount of potential mentors in mentorship_eligibility.csv is also an issue. Having only 1550 eligibly employees will not be enough to train the next generation.
* Overall, it is imperative that Pewlett-Hackard considers hiring talented people, while making sure they continue to develop the talent they already have, if they want to survive the transition into the new generation of workers.

### Summary
#### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.
There is a total of 72,458 employees who's roles will need to be filled. 
#### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
No, considering how large of a company this is, plus how many new ones they would need to hire to replace the ones that are retiring. Therefore, I don't think that the 1550 eligible mentorees will be enough. And that is assuming that all of them are willing to be a mentor.
